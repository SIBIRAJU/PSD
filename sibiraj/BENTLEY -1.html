<h1><center>BENTELY</h1>
<h2 style="color:silver;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<pre>Bentley Motors Limited is a British designer, manufacturer and marketer of<br> luxury cars and SUVs. Headquartered in Crewe, England, the company was founded<br> as Bentley Motors Limited by W. O. Bentley (1888–1971) in 1919 in Cricklewood,<br> North London, and became widely known for winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in<br> 1924, 1927, 1928, 1929 and 1930. Bentley has been a subsidiary of the Volkswagen<br> Group since 1998 and consolidated under VW's premium brand arm Audi since 2022.
Prominent models extend from the historic sports-racing Bentley 4½ Litre and Bentley <br>Speed Six; the more recent Bentley R Type Continental, Bentley Turbo R, and Bentley Arnage;<br> to its current model line, including the Flying Spur, Continental GT, Bentayga and the <br>Mulsanne—which are marketed worldwide, with China as its largest market as of November 2012.
Today most Bentley models are assembled at the company's Crewe factory, with a small number <br>assembled at Volkswagen's Dresden factory, Germany, and with bodies for the Continental<br> manufactured in Zwickau and for the Bentayga manufactured at the Volkswagen Bratislava Plant.
The joining and eventual separation of Bentley and Rolls-Royce followed a series of mergers and <br>acquisitions, beginning with the 1931 purchase by Rolls-Royce of Bentley, then in receivership.<br> In 1971, Rolls-Royce itself was forced into receivership and the UK government nationalised the company<br>—splitting into two companies the aerospace division (Rolls-Royce Plc) and automotive (Rolls-Royce Motors Limited)<br> divisions—the latter retaining the Bentley subdivision. Rolls-Royce Motors was subsequently sold to engineering conglomerate, <br>Vickers and in 1998, Vickers sold Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen AG
Intellectual property rights to both the name Rolls-Royce as well as the company's logo had been retained not by <br>Rolls-Royce Motors, but by aerospace company Rolls-Royce Plc, which had continued to license both to the automotive division.<br> Thus the sale of "Rolls-Royce" to VW included the Bentley name and logos, vehicle designs, model nameplates, production,<br> and administrative facilities, the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grille shape trademarks (subsequently sold to BMW )<br>—but not the rights to the Rolls-Royce name or logo. The aerospace company, Rolls-Royce Plc, ultimately sold both to BMW AG.</pre>

<h2>HISTORY OF BENTLEY</h2>
<img src ="C:\Users\sibir\Downloads\old bentely.jpeg">
<pre>Bentley was founded in 1919 by W. O. Bentley and his brother H. M. Bentley. Their first sports vehicle <br>(a chassis, to be more precise) – the Bentley 3 Litre was shown at the London Motor Show in the same year,<br> while the first cars were delivered in 1921. It was considerably larger from other sports cars at the time<br> but with its innovative technology, the Bentley 3 Litre soon ended the domination of tiny sports cars in racing<br> and attracted a lot of attention among the wealthy British car enthusiasts who formed the so-called Bentley Boys.<br> And it was one from the Bentley Boys – Woolf Barnato who helped the company during financial hardship although W.O.<br> was forced to give up his ownership of the company and become an employee instead. Under Barnato, Bentley produced<br> five more models including the famous Speed Six which is the most successful racing Bentley of all times. After victory<br> of Speed Six at Le Mans of 1930, Bentley would need 73 years to win another Le Mans.
History of Bentley dates back to 1919 when W. O. Bentley and his brother H. M. Bentley founded Bentley Motors Limited.<br> W.O. started dreaming about building his own cars bearing his name shortly after the brothers opened the UK agency for<br> the French DFP (Doriot, Flandrin & Parant) cars in 1912. Soon, he fulfilled his dream and founded what would become one<br> of the most desirable luxury car brands in the world.
After the victory of Bentley 3 Litre Sport at the 24 Hours of Le Mans of 1924, W. O. Bentley’s cars became a major hit among <br>the wealthy British motorists, however, his company was faced with serious financial difficulties as early as 1925. Woolf Barnato,<br> a fan of Bentley cars and a member of the so-called Bentley Boys helped the company with financing which, however, gave him control <br>over the company and made W.O. an employee. The new models that were introduced under Barnato’s chairmanship repeated the success of the<br> Bentley 3 Litre Sport and won Le Mans in 1927, 1928, 1929 and 1930. Despite that, the company was severely hit by the <br>Stock Market Crash of 1929 that was followed by the Great Depression which dramatically reduced the demand for luxury cars such as Bentley.
BentleyIn 1931, an agreement was reached about takeover of Bentley by Napier & Son, however, Napier was outbid by the British Central Equitable<br> Trust. Thus the company was taken over by Rolls-Royce that was behind the British Central Equitable Trust. The real identity of the new Bentley <br>owner, however, was revealed only after the deal was closed. Rolls-Royce formed a new company, while the production was moved to Rolls-Royce’s production<br> facilities in Derby.Bentley factory in Cricklewood was closed. W. O. Bentley who was at the time of Rolls Royce’s takeover still working and designing Bentleys <br>left the company as soon as his contract has expired in 1935. He joined Lagonda where he helped create a line of cars which were “Bentleys in all but name”.
By the end of the 20th century, Bentley and its parent company changed owners twice. After the financial collapse of Rolls-Royce as a result of its development<br> of the RB211 jet engine, the company was nationalised by the British government. The Rolls Royce car division was made an independent business – Rolls-Royce Motors <br>Limited which was acquired by Vickers plc in 1980. Meanwhile, Bentley sales have dropped alarmingly low. But under Vickers, Bentley restored its former reputation <br>as a luxury sports car and the sales started to rise. The so-called Bentley renaissance, however, started only in 1998 when Rolls-Royce Motors Limited was acquired by <br>the Volkswagen Group.
<h2>CONTNENTAL GT<h2>
<img src="C:Users/sibir/Desktop/Bentley-Continental-GT.jpg" width=400 height=300>
<h3>The Bentley Continental GT is iconic. The vehicle has long <br>stood for excess and opulence, and I knew that going in.<br> I expected the Continental GT to be over-engineered and<br> capable of high-speed thrills. And it is, but there’s more.<br>The tester I’m driving costs $279,000. Of course it’s beautiful<br> and fast and dripping with technology. It’s a Bentley. Inside <br>and out, at high speed or low speed, the latest Continental GT<br>exceeded all my expectations.The machine glides over the road,<br> powered by a mechanical symphony performing under the hood. The <br>W12 engine is a dying breed, and it’s a shame. It’s stunning in<br> its performance. This is a 200 mph vehicle, but I didn’t hit<br> those speeds. What surprised me the most is that I didn’t need<br> to go fast. The new Continental GT is thrilling in a way that <br>doesn’t require speed. It’s like a great set of speakers or exclusive<br> liquor. Quality over quantity, and in this mechanical form, the quality is stunning.</h3>
<h2>BENTAYGA</h2>
<img src="C:Users/sibir/Desktop/Bentley_Bentayga.jpg"width=400 height=300>
<h3>The Bentley Bentayga is a mid-size luxury[3] crossover SUV produced by Bentley Motors <br>since late 2015. It is brand's first production SUV (ignoring the 6 special Dominators <br>built for the Sultan of Brunei in the 1990s). Its body is manufactured at the Volkswagen <br>Zwickau-Mosel Plant in Germany, then painted and assembled at Bentley Motor's factory in<br> Crewe, United Kingdom.Bentley's first SUV was previewed as the Bentley EXP 9 F concept car<br> at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. The concept car was based upon the Volkswagen Group MLB platform,<br> powered by a 6.0 L W12 engine producing 600 hp (447 kW).[4] The initial design of the EXP 9 F<br> was redesigned to achieve "more traditional SUV proportions and less retro surfacing."[5]
The production version was announced in July 2013. The Bentley EXP 9 F's design proved to be<br> controversial, and it received a mixed response from the automobile press. After some criticism <br>for the design of the EXP 9 F, Bentley announced that it would change the styling for the production<br> versions.The production Bentayga debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2015 as Bentley's <br>first SUV[6][7] – using unibody construction and full-time all-wheel drive as well as Volkswagen Group's<br> bi-turbo W12 engine and MLB platform, the latter shared with the second-generation Audi Q7 and the third<br>-generation Porsche Cayenne, Audi Q8, and Lamborghini Urus.Available in seating configurations for four, <br>five, or seven, at launch the Bentayga was claimed by the manufacturer as the SUV which has the highest<br> top speed 187 mph (301 km/h) as well as the second most expensive production SUV.A total of 608 "First<br> Edition" units (featuring the 608PS W12) were manufactured upon introduction.The original prediction for <br>2016 was that 3,500 Bentaygas would be sold. When the entire production volume for the year sold out in advance,<br> production was increased and resulted in 5,586 units being sold.

<h2>FLYING SPUR</h2>
<img src="C:/Users/sibir/Downloads/FLYING SPUR bentley.jpg"width=400 height=300>
<h3>The Flying Spur is handcrafted at Bentley's factory in Crewe, England. Each bespoke<br> saloon takes more than 100 hours to assemble completely by hand. Briefly, due to lack<br> of capacity at the Crewe factory upon the car's introduction, 1,358 units of the first<br> generation Flying Spur destined for markets other than the United States and United <br>Kingdom were built at Volkswagen's Transparent Factory in Dresden, Germany. This arrangement<br> ended in early 2007, when all assembly works reverted to Crewe in England.The first-generation <br>Flying Spur was officially unveiled at the 75th Geneva Motor Show in March 2005.[2] It had a <br>5,998 cc (6.0 L) twin-turbocharged W12 engine tuned to produce 560 PS (412 kW; 552 bhp) and <br>torque of 650 N⋅m (479 lbf⋅ft) at 1,600–6,100 rpm. Torsen-based permanent all-wheel drive system<br> was standard on the Flying Spur. It can go 0–100 km/h (0.0–62.1 mph) in 4.9 seconds, and can <br>reach a top speed of 314 km/h (195 mph).[3][4] It also has Adaptive Air Suspension and Continuous<br> Damping Control as standard. At that time, it was the world's fastest and most powerful production<br> saloon.[5]Sales of the first-generation Flying Spur began in late 2005.[6] During the first full-year <br>sales of the Flying Spur, the number of deliveries exceeded 4,000 units.[7] The Speed model of the Flying <br>Spur was introduced in 2008 as a higher performance variant with revised ceramic disc brakes and tuned to<br> produce 602 horsepower. The acceleration of the Speed model is 0–100 km/h (0.0–62.1 mph) in 4.5 <br>seconds, and can reach a top speed of 322 km/h (200 mph). The total production of the first generation<br> Flying Spur was 19,786 units while only a limited number of 1,155 units of the Speed model were ever made.

<h2>MULSANNE</h2>
<img src="C:/Users/sibir/Downloads/bentley mulsanne.jpg"width=400 height=300>
<h3>The Bentley Mulsanne is a full-size luxury car that was manufactured by Bentley<br> from 2010 to 2020.[6] The car is named after the Mulsanne Straight of the Le <br>Mans racing circuit, where Bentley have raced many of its cars through<br>out history. Designed to replace the Rolls-Royce based Arnage, the Mulsanne<br> was the first flagship car to be independently designed by Bentley Motors <br>since W.O. Bentley's 8 litre model in 1930 The Mulsanne nameplate was last used<br> by Bentley for a four-door saloon that was built between 1980 and 1992. It was<br> resurrected as the nameplate for what would become the replacement for the Arnage,<br> Bentley's then flagship model. The new Mulsanne was unveiled at the 2009 Pebble<br> Beach Concours d'Elegance held on 16 August,[8] followed by the 2009 Frankfurt<br> Motor Show,[8] 2010 North American International Auto Show,[9] and the 2012 Qatar <br>Motor Show.[10] At the time of its launch, a coupé and convertible variant were expected<br>to follow at some point as replacements for the Arnage-based Brooklands and Azure respectively <br>but the coupé never came to fruition,[11] while a convertible has been made available towards<br> the end of the production run. Like the Arnage, the Mulsanne retains the 6.75 L (6,750 cc;<br> 412 cu in) Bentley L Series V8 engine, modified to meet Euro V emissions regulations. The engine <br>is lighter and features cylinder de-activation and variable cam phasing to improve fuel efficiency.<br> Unlike the less expensive Continental Flying Spur and Continental GT, the Mulsanne shares fewer common<br> components with other marques in the Volkswagen Group.[13]Models
