<h4>Bentley Motors Limited is a British designer, manufacturer and marketer of<br> luxury cars and SUVs. Headquartered in Crewe, England, the company was founded<br> as Bentley Motors Limited by W. O. Bentley (1888–1971) in 1919 in Cricklewood,<br> North London, and became widely known for winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in<br> 1924, 1927, 1928, 1929 and 1930. Bentley has been a subsidiary of the Volkswagen<br> Group since 1998 and consolidated under VW's premium brand arm Audi since 2022.
Prominent models extend from the historic sports-racing Bentley 4½ Litre and Bentley <br>Speed Six; the more recent Bentley R Type Continental, Bentley Turbo R, and Bentley Arnage;<br> to its current model line, including the Flying Spur, Continental GT, Bentayga and the <br>Mulsanne—which are marketed worldwide, with China as its largest market as of November 2012.
Today most Bentley models are assembled at the company's Crewe factory, with a small number <br>assembled at Volkswagen's Dresden factory, Germany, and with bodies for the Continental<br> manufactured in Zwickau and for the Bentayga manufactured at the Volkswagen Bratislava Plant.
The joining and eventual separation of Bentley and Rolls-Royce followed a series of mergers and <br>acquisitions, beginning with the 1931 purchase by Rolls-Royce of Bentley, then in receivership.<br> In 1971, Rolls-Royce itself was forced into receivership and the UK government nationalised the company<br>—splitting into two companies the aerospace division (Rolls-Royce Plc) and automotive (Rolls-Royce Motors Limited)<br> divisions—the latter retaining the Bentley subdivision. Rolls-Royce Motors was subsequently sold to engineering conglomerate, <br>Vickers and in 1998, Vickers sold Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen AG
Intellectual property rights to both the name Rolls-Royce as well as the company's logo had been retained not by <br>Rolls-Royce Motors, but by aerospace company Rolls-Royce Plc, which had continued to license both to the automotive division.<br> Thus the sale of "Rolls-Royce" to VW included the Bentley name and logos, vehicle designs, model nameplates, production,<br> and administrative facilities, the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grille shape trademarks (subsequently sold to BMW )<br>—but not the rights to the Rolls-Royce name or logo. The aerospace company, Rolls-Royce Plc, ultimately sold both to BMW AG.</pre></h4></div>
